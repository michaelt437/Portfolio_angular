            The purpose of the project was to become familiar with conditionals and printing variables with Python.  The calculator application presents the user with different choices of arithmetic operations to perform: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power.  This requires the application to take in user input and perform functions depending on the input.  Users will be prompted to input numbers required for the particular operation.  After computation is completed, the application will print results in formats based on the operation, such as integers or decimals.  Each operation has its own condition, and after any operation has been completed, the menu will continue to be printed until the user selects Exit.
