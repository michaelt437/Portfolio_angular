            I wanted to learn as much as I could about JavaScript and what the scripting language allows you to do with web pages.  I wanted to work more with larger images, so I spent the most time creating my own slider animation for the portal page.  The slider was written using JQuery, and I continued to use JQuery throughout the project, specifically the navigation bar.  Another horizontal navigation menu, this time I animated a show/hide slide effect for mousing over the pages.  The project also includes forms with scripts that change opacity on focus and alert pop-ups on submission.  JavaScript was also used for the mouseover image galleries.
