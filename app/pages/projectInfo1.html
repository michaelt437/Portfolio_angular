            For the final project in CMST 385, I wanted to created an online portfolio for my artwork.  I enjoy browsing and looking through other online portfolios of artists I follow for inspiration and to appreciate their skill.  I had several pieces I had done for art classes and as personal pieces and I wanted to portray them online in a similar fashion.  Using HTML5 to organize the content and CSS3 to style my artwork portfolio, I wanted to include common art portfolio features, such as grid layouts and large images as backgrounds.  I also used this project to practice coding and styling a horizontal navigation bar and hover effects for links and objects.
