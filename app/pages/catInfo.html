This was simple web application built during an AngularJS training course during my summer internship.  The training covered important  basics of AngularJS, including routing and views, sorting the content that is displayed in the view, and AngularJS’s methods of storing and printing information.  A search bar and dropdown menu are included to demonstrate sorting - the dropdown presents the option to either sort the items alphabetically or by newest, while the search bar will filter the items based on the query.  AngularJS allows for the view to be updated immediately.  The data displayed when viewing individual items was pulled from a JSON file containing the information.  Using AngularJS’s data binding, the application appears to be traditionally dynamic (server calls) while only operating on the client side.        </p>
