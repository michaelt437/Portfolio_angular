            Having more experience and confidence with HTML5 and CSS3 allowed me to explore different design decisions with this project.  I wanted to tackle designing a large scale website, so I pulled inspiration from news sites I frequent that publish articles on technology and design.  I wanted to experiment with CSS3 transitions and created an animated banner for the home page.  I also created a fixed horizontal navigation bar that remains at the top of the window while scrolling, and it also contains mini menus that appear on mouseover.  I created a form for this project as well, and this time, Iâ€™ve included a small JavaScript validation function to check for a completed form on submission.
