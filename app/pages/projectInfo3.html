            Flash Project
        </h1>

            Learning Flash was interesting because of the similarities it shared with other creative software I’ve used, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator.  I wanted to create an art portfolio similar to HTML Project 1 using Flash’s creative tools and ActionScript, as well as use a different color scheme.  With this project, I incorporated sound into the application - navigation links have audios to go with clicks, and background music can be turned on and off.  The same features that can be coded using HTML and CSS were reproduced using Flash, such as page “redirects”, hover effects, and a form.  The form was created to simulate an online store section of the application.  As a Shockwave Flash object, this project is essentially a single page application.
